# Lab002 - Fun with lists

*deadline: 2 weeks*

We will cover:
1. List API
2. Property based testing using Quick Check
3. Our first typeclass: `Ord`

This week we will do exercies that appear occasionally at job interviews: Quicksort algorithm and FizzBuzz. Both solutions should manifest themself the beauty of the Haskell language - once you are done, just compare them with anything written in any other programming language. 
They are both perfect for mastering some functions available for `List`. They also help get intuition when reasoning about lazy evaluation.
Abstract version of quicksort implementation will require to understand concept of a typeclass and usage of an `Ord` typeclass.
We will also have to test our solutions, so this is a great opportunity to introduce QuickCheck.

Programs:

#### Quicksort for list of integers

1. Implement a [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) algorithm that will take a list of integers as an input and return a sorted list of integers as an output. We are not looking for the most performant version, just the simplest version of this well known divide and conquer algorithm.
2. Write property based tests using QuickCheck that will test your solution. Think about the properties that you can check.

```
$ stack exec exercise2-exe 3 32 2 1 2 5 5 321 1 123 12 3 43 345
[1,1,2,2,3,3,5,5,12,32,43,123,321,345]
```

#### Quick Sort for everyone!

1. Extend your Quicksort algorithm to work with a list of any arbitrary type
2. What are possible constraints on that type?

#### FizzBuzz

1. Implement a program [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) that will take a number as an input and generate list of strings as the output containing the "fizzbuzz" sequence
2. Can you think of any properties that you could test with QuickCheck?
