# LAB001 - Hello World 

*deadline: 1 week*

We will cover:
1. How to init a new Haskell project
2. using the `IO` type
3. divide project to modules

This week is all about getting started. Familiarize yourself with [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and basic concepts of the language: function definition and application, module creation, `IO` type.

Programs:

#### 1. Write a program that prints out "Hello worlds" and terminates

```
$ stack exec exercise1-exe
Hello World
```

#### 2. Write a program that welcomes the user, asks for his/her name, greets user and terminates

```
$ stack exec exercise1-exe
Hello, what is your name?
Pawel
Nice to meet you Pawel
```

#### 3. Write a program that will run program 2. in an infinite loop

```
$ stack exec exercise1-exe
Hello, what is your name?
Pawel
Nice to meet you Pawel
Hello, what is your name?
Mike
Nice to meet you Mike
Hello, what is your name?
Kate
Nice to meet you Kate
Hello, what is your name?
```
